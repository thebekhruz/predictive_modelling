- **Definition**: When two or more independent variables are highly correlated, making it difficult to determine their individual effects.
    
- **How to Detect**:
    
    - Correlation matrix
    - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- **Implications**:
    
    - Can cause instability in regression models.
    - Makes feature importance harder to interpret.
- **Solutions**:
    
    - Remove redundant features
    - Use PCA or feature engineering
    - Regularization (Ridge Regression)
