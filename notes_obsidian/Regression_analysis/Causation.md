- **Definition**: A change in one variable directly causes a change in another.
- **Correlation vs. Causation**: Just because two variables are correlated doesnâ€™t mean one causes the other.
- **How to Test for Causation**:
    - Randomised experiments
    - Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
    - Granger Causality test
