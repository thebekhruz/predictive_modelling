****Label Encoding****Â is a technique that is used to convert categorical columns into numerical ones so that they can be fitted by machine learning models which only take numerical data. It is an important pre-processing step in a machine-learning project. It assigns a unique integer to each category in the data, making it suitable for machine-learning models that work with numerical inputs.
